        "It was beautiful. <br>
        He was the point of difference. <br>
        He has always been the point of difference. <br>
        Unparalleled. <br><br>
        And maybe today, <br>
        There will, of course, always be those who argue, <br>
        Always be those who debate. <br>
        And the debate can rage on if you like. <br><br>
        But as he falls in love <br>
        With the object in the world that his heart most desired, <br>
        It is hard to escape the supposition <br>
        That he has rendered himself today <br>
        The greatest of all time."
